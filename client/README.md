# Scheduler for WOPR empoyees

This is a project for my current job, which facilitates the creation of dispositions for the next month's work.

We have always created our schedules in a rather ugly looking excel file that poorly visualized the prepared disposition.

I came up with the idea of creating a website that facilitates the creation of such a schedule by displaying a large calendar. The user enters his or her Name, then proceeds to create his or her disposition, after making changes, the user can see how many hours he or she will potentially receive and the resulting compensation. Finally, he can export this data to the same excel file we use.
